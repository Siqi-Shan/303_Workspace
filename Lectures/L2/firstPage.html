            Pikachu is a short, chubby rodent Pok√©mon. It is covered in yellow
            fur with two horizontal brown stripes on its back. It has a small
            mouth, long, pointed ears with black tips, brown eyes, and the two
            red circles on its cheeks contain pouches for electricity storage.
            It has short forearms with five fingers on each paw, and its feet
            each have three toes. At the base of its lightning bolt-shaped tail
            is a patch of brown fur. A female will have a V-shaped notch at the
            end of its tail, which looks like the top of a heart. It is
            classified as quadruped, but it has been known to stand and walk on
            its hind legs.
